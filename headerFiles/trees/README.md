# **TREES**
A tree is a non-linear data structure, which is a set of nodes, where one node 
is root of the tree and all the remaining nodes are arranged in a **hierarchical 
order** forming sub-tree of the root.

## TYPES OF TREES
**Trees are of 6 types.**

  1. General Trees
  2. Forests
  3. Binary Trees
        1. Complete Binary Trees
        2. Extended Binary Trees
  4. Binary search Trees
  5. Expression Trees
  6. Tournament Trees

## BASIC TERMINOLOGY

  - Root Node
    `The topmost node in the tree.`

  - Sub-Trees
    `Branch under a node.`

  - Leaf/Terminal Node
    `A node that has no nodes under it`

  - Path
    `A sequence of nodes to the edges.`

  - Ancestor node
    `predecessor node on the path from root to a node.`

  - Descendant node 
    `successor node on any path from the node to a leaf node.`
