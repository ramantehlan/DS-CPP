# TREES
A tree is a non-linear data structure, which is a set of nodes, where one node is root of the tree and all the remaining nodes are arranged in a **hierarchical 
order** forming sub-tree of the root.

## TYPES OF TREES
**Trees are of 6 types.**

  1. General Trees 
  2. Forests
  3. Binary Trees
        1. Complete Binary Trees
        2. Extended Binary Trees
  4. Binary Search Trees
  5. Expression Trees
  6. Tournament Trees

## BASIC TERMINOLOGY

  - **Root Node:**
    The topmost node in the tree.

  - **Sub-Trees:**
    Branch under a node.

  - **Leaf/Terminal Node:**
    A node that has no nodes under it

  - **Path:**
    A sequence of nodes to the edges.

  - **Ancestor node:**
    Predecessor node on the path from the root to a node.

  - **Descendant node:** 
    Successor node on any path from the node to a leaf node.

  - **Level Number:** 
    the hierarchical number of a node. example: root node is at level 0, child nodes of the root are at level 1 and so on.

  - **Parent:**
    Predecessor node on the path from the root to a node. 
    
  - **Left Child:**
    Left successor node.
    
  - **Right Child:**
    Right successor node.
    
  - **Degree of a node:**
    Number of children that a node has.
    
  - **Sibling:**
    All nodes that are at the same level, share the same parents.
    
  - **Similar binary trees:**
    Trees with the same structure.
  
  - **Copies:**
    Trees with same structure and content.
    
  - **Edge:**
    The line connecting a node to any of its child nodes. (N nodes has exactly N-1 edges)
