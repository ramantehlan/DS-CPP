# TREES
A tree is a non-linear data structure, which is a set of nodes, where one node 
is root of the tree and all the remaining nodes are arranged in a **hierarchical 
order** forming sub-tree of the root.

## TYPES OF TREES
**Trees are of 6 types.**

  1. General Trees
  2. Forests
  3. Binary Trees
        1. Complete Binary Trees
        2. Extended Binary Trees
  4. Binary search Trees
  5. Expression Trees
  6. Tournament Trees

## BASIC TERMINOLOGY

  - **Root Node**
    The topmost node in the tree.

  - **Sub-Trees**
    Branch under a node.

  - **Leaf/Terminal Node**
    A node that has no nodes under it

  - **Path**
    A sequence of nodes to the edges.

  - **Ancestor node**
    Predecessor node on the path from root to a node.

  - **Descendant node** 
    Successor node on any path from the node to a leaf node.

  - **Level Number** 
    hierarchical number of a node. example: root node is at level 0, child 
     nodes of root is at level 1 and so on.

  **Binary Trees Terminology**

  - **Parent**
